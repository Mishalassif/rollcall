 abstract = {One of the most cited books in mathematics, John Milnor's exposition of Morse theory has been the most important book on the subject for more than forty years. Morse theory was developed in the 1920s by mathematician Marston Morse. (Morse was on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Princeton published hisTopological Methods in the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variablein the Annals of Mathematics Studies series in 1947.) One classical application of Morse theory includes the attempt to understand, with only limited information, the large-scale structure of an object. This kind of problem occurs in mathematical physics, dynamic systems, and mechanical engineering. Morse theory has received much attention in the last two decades as a result of a famous paper in which theoretical physicist Edward Witten relates Morse theory to quantum field theory.Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal (the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel Prize) in 1962 for his work in differential topology. He has since received the National Medal of Science (1967) and the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society twice (1982 and 2004) in recognition of his explanations of mathematical concepts across a wide range of scienti.c disciplines. The citation reads, "The phrase sublime elegance is rarely associated with mathematical exposition, but it applies to all of Milnor's writings. Reading his books, one is struck with the ease with which the subject is unfolding and it only becomes apparent after re.ection that this ease is the mark of a master.?Milnor has published five books with Princeton University Press.},

Abstract = {Let $M$ be a compact $C^\infty$ manifold with boundary $\partial M$. A smooth real-valued function $f$ on $M$ is said to be an $m$-function if (i) $f|\partial M$ is a Morse function, (ii) $f$ has no critical points on $\partial M$, (iii) $f$ has only nondegenerate critical points. The authors prove Morse inequalities which relate the relative Betti numbers of $M\ \text{mod}\,\partial M$ to the Morse numbers of $f$ and $f|\partial M$.},

The rank invariant completely determines the multidimensional analogue of persistent homology groups. We prove that multidimensional rank invariants are stable with respect to function perturbations. More precisely, we construct a distance between rank invariants such that small changes of the function imply only small changes of the rank invariant. This result can be obtained by assuming the function to be just continuous. Multidimensional stability opens the way to a stable shape comparison methodology based on multidimensional persistence.},

In recent work Bubenik introduced the persistence landscape, a stable representation of persistence diagrams amenable to statistical analysis and machine learning tools. In this paper we generalise the persistence landscape to multiparameter persistence modules providing a stable representation of the rank invariant. We show that multiparameter landscapes are stable with respect to the interleaving distance and persistence weighted Wasserstein distance, and that the collection of multiparameter landscapes faithfully represents the rank invariant. Finally we provide example calculations and statistical tests to demonstrate a range of potential applications and how one can interpret the landscapes associated to a multiparameter module.},

	abstract = {A theory of modules over posets is developed to deО╛│ne computationally feasible, topologically interpretable data structures, in terms of birth and death of homology classes, for persistent homology with multiple real parameters. To replace the noetherian hypothesis in the general setting of modules over posets, for theoretical as well as computational purposes, a О╛│nitely encoded condition is deО╛│ned combinatorially and developed algebraically. The О╛│nitely encoded hypothesis captures topological tameness of persistent homology, and poset-modules satisfying it can be speciО╛│ed by fringe presentations that reО╛┌ect birth-and-death descriptions of persistent homology. The homological theory of modules over posets culminates in a syzygy theorem characterizing О╛│nitely encoded modules as those that admit О╛│nite presentations or resolutions by direct sums of upset modules or downset modules, which are analogues over posets of О╛┌at and injective modules over multigraded polynomial rings.},
